    <h1>First run (Gab Encoding Converter only)</h1>
    <p>After you clicked the icon of Gab Encoding Converter, the following window appears :</p>
    <img src="images/firstrun.jpg" width="800" height="500" />
    <p>You can see that the interface of Gab Encoding Converter is divided in 3 main parts :</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Menu and toolbars on the top</li>
      <li>Source file on the left</li>
      <li>Destination file on the right</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While it could appear not very useful to have a new document opened when you start Gab Encoding Converter, it can actually be of some interest if you copy/paste some text in one of the two panes and change its encoding using the live preview. However the prefered use of Gab Encoding Converter is of course to open an existing file.
